 1   Take two inputs from user and check whether they are equal or not.
Ans: print ("Enter first number")
     first = input()
     print ("Enter second number")
     second = input()
     print (first == second)

 2.  Take 3 inputs from user and check :
           all are equal
           any of two are equal
           ( use and or )
Ans: print ("first number")
     first = input()
     print ("second number")
     second = input()
     print ("third number")
     third = input()
     all = first == second and second == third and third == first
     print "All are equal:",all
     any = first == second or second == third or third == first
     print "Any of two are equal:",any

 3.  Take two number and check whether the sum is greater than 5, less than 5 or equal to 5.
Ans: print ("Enter first number")
     first = input()
     print ("Enter second number")
     second = input()
     sum = first+second
     print ("sum is greater than 5:",sum>5)
     print ("sum is equal to 5:",sum==5)
     print ("sum is lesser than 5:",sum<5)

 4.  Suppose passing marks of a subject is 35. Take input of marks from user and check whether it is greater than passing marks or not.
Ans: pm = 35
     marks = input()
     print ("Marks is greater than passing marks:"),marks>pm

 5.  Write a Python function to find the Max of three numbers.
Ans: num1 = 134
     num2 = 120
     num3 = 143
     if (num1 >= num2) and (num1 >= num3):
     largest = num1
     elif (num2 >= num1) and (num2 >= num3):
     largest = num2
     else:
     largest = num3
     print("The largest number is", largest)
